				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The project is a seat allotment software designed to automate the process of allocating seats in
						educational institutions.</li>
					<li>The software simplifies the task of seat allocation by using data provided by the institute
						authority and the system can allocate seats based on various criteria such as merit,
						reservation, and availability.</li>
					<li>The software aims to streamline the seat allocation process and reduce the workload of
						administrators, making the process more efficient and accurate.</li>
					<li>The software can help to improve the credibility of the institution or organization.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Objectives</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>To develop a software application to allot seats based on seat-matrix by processing the choice
						data for various counselling rounds of UG enginerring (1st Year) programs.</li>
					<li>To generate various reports like Institute wise cutoff, Program wise Cutoff, Most Pre- ferred
						Branch, Waiting List Report, etc.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Feasibility Study</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Technological Feasibility: It is technically feasible to use Python to create the software logic
						and SQL to administer the database.</li>
					<li>Economic Viability: Python and SQL are a cost-effective combination for creating and deploying
						the seat allocation program.</li>
					<li>Operational Suitability: The software should be scalable and capable of handling high data
						volumes.</li>
					<li>Legal Liability: The seat distribution program must abide by laws governing data security,
						privacy, and accessibility.</li>
				</ul>

					<h2>Methodology/Planning of Work</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Requirement Gathering: Gather the requirements of the software from the institution
							authority.
						</li>
						<li>Design and Planning: Design the software architecture and plan the development process.</li>
						<li>Development: Develop the software using Python for the logic and SQL for the database.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Methodology/Planning of Work</h2>
					<ol>
						4. Testing: Test the developed software to ensure that it meets the requirements of the
						institution
						and is free from bugs or errors.
						<!-- A line space -->
						<br>
						<br>
						5. Deployment: Deploy the software on the institutionâ€™s servers and make it available for use
						by
						the administrators.
						<br>
						<br>
						6. Maintenance: Periodic maintenance and updates will be required to keep the software running
						smoothly.

					<h2>Facilities Required</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Hardware: The developer will require a dedicated set of hardware, including computers or
							laptops with a dual-core processor and 8 GB of RAM.</li>
						<li>Software: The required software includes Python and SQL, along with any necessary libraries
							and frameworks.</li>
						<li>Development Environment: A development environment will be needed for coding, debugging,
							and testing the software.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Facilities Required</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Database Management System: A database management system, such as MySQL, will be required
							to manage the database.</li>
						<li>Internet Connection: An internet connection will be required for accessing online
							resources and testing the software.</li>
						<li>Testing Environment: A separate testing environment will be required to test the software.
						</li>
					</ul>
